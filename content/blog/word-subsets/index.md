## [Word Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-subsets/)

We are given two arrays `A` and `B` of words. Each word is a string of lowercase letters.

Now, say that word `b` is a subset of word `a` if every letter in `b` occurs in `a`, including **multiplicity**.  For example, `"wrr"` is a subset of `"warrior"`, but is not a subset of `"world"`.

Now say a word `a` from `A` is universal if for every `b` in `B`, `b` is a subset of `a`. 

Return a list of all universal words in `A`.  You can return the words in any order.

Example 1:

**Input**: A = `["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"]`, B = `["e","o"]`  
**Output**: `["facebook","google","leetcode"]`

Example 2:

**Input**: A = `["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"]`, B = `["l","e"]`  
**Output**: `["apple","google","leetcode"]`

Example 3:

**Input**: A = `["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"]`, B = `["e","oo"]`  
**Output**: `["facebook","google"]`

Example 4:

**Input**: A = `["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"]`, B = `["lo","eo"]`  
**Output**: `["google","leetcode"]`

**Note**:

1. `1 <= A.length, B.length <= 10000`
2. `1 <= A[i].length, B[i].length <= 10`
3. `A[i]` and `B[i]` consist only of lowercase letters.
4. All words in `A[i]` are unique: there isn't `i != j` with `A[i] == A[j]`.
